<h2 id="about">About this report</h2>
To make Nine Worlds 2015 a more enjoyable, inclusive and welcoming event, we think it's important to listen to what people are saying about their experiences. This report collates and responds to feedback on Nine Worlds 2014, and forms part of our planning
for future events. It's also a good starting point for people wanting to find out more about the event, and for placing individual experiences in a wider context. It's worth noting that quotes used in the report are a representative sample only â€“ a full
recounting of what everyone wrote would take 60 pages for the survey feedback alone.
<h3 id="how-to-read">How to read this report</h3>
The entire report is one webpage. You can read from beginning to end by scrolling down, or use the links above to find specific parts. There are three elements to each section of the report:
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Data</strong> - We asked people to rate their experience on a scale from very negative to very positive, and summarised the results as a chart. In each chart, 0% means that everyone answered 'very negative', 33% means that the average response was 'somewhat
		negative', 66% means that the average response was 'somewhat positive' and 100% means that everyone answered 'very positive'.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Comments</strong> - A selection of survey comments. These are meant to act as a cross-section of the complete set of comments, which extend to more than 60 pages. The data sections are often substantially more positive than the comments. We believe
		this is because the 2014 survey's design encouraged people to use the text fields to expand on problems and issues they had.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Response</strong> - The organisers' response to the feedback we've received in this area.
	</li>
</ul>
For more information about the survey's design and the methodology, there's a <a href="#technical">technical section at the end of the report</a>.

<h2 id="programme">Feedback about the programme</h2>
This section explores how people felt about the content and organisation of <a href="/sites/nineworlds.co.uk/schedule/index.html#info.">336 sessions</a> and <a href="/2014/track">30 tracks</a> that took place at <a href="/2014">Nine Worlds 2014</a>.

<h3 id="programme-comments">Comments</h3>

<h4>General comments on programme</h4>
<blockquote>Generally very good, it might an idea to have whiteboards or noticeboards available next time?</blockquote>
<blockquote>seemed a shame that several tracks only ran one day</blockquote>
<blockquote>The noise issue from the room next to the social gaming track meant it was impossible for me to attend these panels as someone with a hearing disability, and I had to leave one because it was so physically painful</blockquote>
<blockquote>is there some way to make sure that attendees at 18+ panels are 18+. Just asking them seems risky and more difficult for security at the door. Maybe wristbands that can't be removed for 18+ attendees?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Better communication to the hotel next time and make sure drop in spaces are open from the very start of the day (this would have been more than fine for our purposes)</blockquote>
<blockquote>As a pro author, I was hoping to be offered more appropriate panel invitations - I shall be more focused in my communications next year!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Exemplary in almost all respects - just a few niggles. Bijou Bar wasn't a great venue for RPGs, however the Storygasm people made the best of it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Fantastic convention, looking to go again next year</blockquote>
<blockquote>I love being at Nine Worlds.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We could have done with an open quiet area, to rest between sessions without flitting lonelyly between benches.</blockquote>

<h4>Session content</h4>
<blockquote>I thought that sessions such as [an 18+ session] were inappropriate and unsuitable for this event.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some of the best panels I have ever experienced.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some of the early Friday sessions went off subject for large portions of the panel and also some of the panelist had limited knowledge of the subject.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Everything feels very 101; I'm sure this is great for welcoming new people to the discussions, but I would like more substance.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Most of the sessions were great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Content was good at all I attended</blockquote>
<blockquote>The sessions I attended were all great and very wll organised, and the speakers were all very friendly and willing to discuss the topics further after the session was due.</blockquote>

<h4>Session moderation</h4>
<blockquote>Moderation was on the whole very good, and I think the guidelines are a great idea.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We were mostly happy with the moderation, but one or two panels weren't quite as well moderated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I think it might be helpful next year to have a bit more guidance for panelists around how to use the microphones (I spent both my panels worried that I was inaudible) and also things like how long before the panel to meet up and whether/how to get in
	contact with other panelists beforehand. (The latter might be something track heads might need to organise.)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Moderators occasionally did not follow the guidelines, leading to one incident I witnessed of misgendering which upset the attendee.</blockquote>
<blockquote>One of the moderators had difficulty dealing with an audience member who would dominate discussion at the end, and regularly raise points mid talk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some sessions that I attended were better moderated than others. But generally very good</blockquote>
<blockquote>Both the room sizes and moderation were much improved from last year; there were a couple of sessions that risked degenerating into just rec lists, but the moderators steered the conversation to more substantial topics.</blockquote>
<blockquote>presenters should have been made to use mics. Many didn't and were inaudible. Very tough on those at the back and with hearing issues.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I liked the non-gendered selection of audience members to speak by moderators</blockquote>
<blockquote>You only notice moderation when its intrusive to discussion. There was some of this in a few sessions, but on the whole things were excellent handled. A few times the topic appeared to be a bit beyond the guests, but that can be dependent on your knowledge
	approaching it.</blockquote>

<h4>Choice of sessions</h4>
<blockquote>Absolutely brilliant programme, just wish I had more time to go to everything.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Really interesting collection of tracks, always something interesting during the day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The diversity and content of the programme was very impressive. so much so that i will be coming back next year</blockquote>
<blockquote>Great to have so much choice, but tricky to make one and to find time to eat. Things running late is frustrating when tough session choices made.</blockquote>
<blockquote>My main suggestion would that it would be nice to have a bit more "unscheduled" activity. Like, access to boardgames or similar. Felt a bit like find from panel to panel with little in between. (Not that the panels were a hardship!)</blockquote>

<h4>Match of room size and session popularity</h4>
<blockquote>Room size/popularity match was a huge problem in 2013, this year it was perfect!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some panels had way too few chairs. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Geek Feminism track was put in a tiny room and every session I went to was wildly oversubscribed. Doors shut, many people turned away.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Rooms generally matched content, though the more popular sessions like the mummies lecture could have had more suitable rooms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There were still a few sessions with fairly popular guests that needed a bigger room, but again it was leaps and bounds beyond last year. </blockquote>
<blockquote>I think it's often hard to predict which sessions will be very popular, but certainly Only a Moment should have been in a room with more chairs.</blockquote>

<h4>Length of sessions</h4>
<blockquote>My attention span sometimes wasn't up to the length of the sessions, but I didn't feel pressured to stay in anything longer than I wanted which was lovely</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some sessions were very rushed, maybe having some longer ones would be useful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The session length was perfect. </blockquote>
<blockquote>For some longer sessions a couple of minutes break might have been nice. Generally excellent though</blockquote>

<h4>Gaps between sessions</h4>
<blockquote>A slightly longer gap between sessions in the middle of the day to forage would be useful</blockquote>
<blockquote>There were occasions when I would have liked slightly longer between sessions, however I know this would probably have meant less of them, and I'd prefer a shorter break and the range of sessions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Timing was rather tight, especially when sessions run over</blockquote>
<blockquote>The gaps between items was a great idea!!!</blockquote>
<blockquote>There was insufficient time to eat between sessions, and I didn't want to miss any sessions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I never felt too rushed to get to the next thing (way better than last year!)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Gaps between sessions were fine but would be nicer if there was a bit longer for lunch and dinner scheduled in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I love the gaps between sessions. Made eating and socialising much easier!</blockquote>

<h4>Schedule planning support</h4>
<blockquote>Cancellations/time shifts were very poorly communicated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loved the scheduling app!</blockquote>
<blockquote>The online schedule was terrible this year - session schedules were not updated with changes. Lanyrd was SO much better in 2013</blockquote>
<blockquote>The only problem with scheduling was in publicising changes to schedules and venues - there were often groups of confused attendees haunting the halls when this happened.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bad hotel wi-fi coverage meant that online schedule planning was often unavailable</blockquote>
<blockquote>Had issues with mobile session planner on chromium browsers on my phone. Fortunetely firefox worked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>the online schedule was useful, but would be better if all events were clearly updated when moved or cancelled: some either disappeared mysteriously (instead of saying cancelled) or didn't get updated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>live updates to web programme were invaluable</blockquote>
<blockquote>App/web page was bloody brilliant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The schedule app was really useful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Planning app was brilliant.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Please coudl i ask, woudl it be possibel to produce the track listings on an A3 1 grid format? even if this is only emialed out, i was having a lot of trouble navigating the grid spread over multiple pages (dyslexia has its downsides).</blockquote>

<h4>Schedule information and session descriptions</h4>
<blockquote>It'd be more helpful in the lengthy descriptions of sessions to have them more closely grouped by day (or even morning/afternoon) rather than having to flick between timetable and session descriptions. Seriosuly though, what was in the book was pretty
	bloody impressive.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Would have been helpful if workshop sessions were clearly marked as such (e.g. in the Creative Writing track). Some sessions could have done with more content warnings - e.g. long unmoderated audience discussions of [rape and related topics] in [a guest]'s
	talk. The LGBTQIA track did an excellent job with content warnings - other tracks should follow their example.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I would have found it a little easier to use the timetables at the back of the "book of everything" if the time axis had been consistently scaled, and if it had been aligned across pages.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I am a very organised person so being able to create my own schedule online and then print it out was just awesome.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A few of the streams had evocative but not very informative descriptions, particularly the All The Books stream - we had no idea what sone of the panels were about, which meant that when there's so much choice available we might have missed out on something
	we would have enjoyed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It would also help to be clearer on the difference between a panel where the audience sits and watches versus a group discussion in the room where the panel are experts.</blockquote>

<h4>General comments on programme tracks</h4>
<blockquote>What's not to like?!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Could somebody give mods and track runners on ALL tracks a LGBTQAI and Race/Culture primer they have to follow. So people know what gender identity and gender expression are, and other things I probably don't know much about. Maybe some stuff on disability
	and neurodiversity too. Most mods and track runners were fine and I never came across one who messed up on purpose but it seems like it'd be useful for mods/track runners of non-related tracks/etc to have.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Unfortunately most of these were of little interest to me, and I am no longer sure what intersection of geekdom I really belong in. I am obviously not as right-on and hand-knitted as you cater for, but I'm out of place at a mainstream media con. Alas!</blockquote>
<blockquote>It was awesome! So many things I only regret not having time to attend to them all!</blockquote>
<blockquote>the tracks were mostly awesome.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Too much fandom stuff, not enough science and astronomy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The one thing that was really missing was a boardgames room. They're my favourite way to meet new people, and with impromptu games you've brought along, it's easier to always end up playing with the same old social circle. I wouldn't mind helping to organise
	one if that was the issue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>All the astronomy things were on Friday so I had less incentive to return Saturday or Sunday.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Can't judge the tracks I didn't attend, but I loved all the ones I did!</blockquote>
<blockquote>I loved the lgbtqia track, bifrost, haberdashery collective and knitting. Most things I went to were great.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Personally not a big fan of the very strong tracks, like to cross the streams a bit more.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The choice of tracks was overwhelming, astonishing and made sure there was never any time to be bored.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Lots of these tracks I didn't even go to but I am convinced they were superb, I had a great time and everyone was lovely and I'm telling everyone I know to come next year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Really enjoyed the Future Tech track (went to 5-6 talks), books, food and comics</blockquote>
<blockquote>I have to admit there was so much going on I only dipped into a few things.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Was only there on Saturday so didn't get the chance to experience content across all tracks but the things I went to were excellent.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Such awesome. Many choice. So fun.</blockquote>
<blockquote>One or two of the tracks ([one] in particular) seemed muddled, ill-prepared and like the content had been thrown together. I liked the scope of the tracks, though, and think things could be vastly improved from a little more preparation and support for
	people new to organising a session.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Amazing selection as ever - had at least 2 things that were interesting in every slot. Keep up the great work!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Far too many of the panels consisted of people that all agreed with each other resulting in a lack of interesting debate but rather a sequence of people saying the same thing in a different way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I spent most of my time in Geek Feminism, Race & Culture and LGBTQIA+, all of which had consistently excellent talks. The talks on other tracks I went to (several Academia, one Skeptics, one Ships/Clocks/Stars, one All The Books) were also very good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>More Food and Tech talks, please!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sadly there wasn't enough time to get to something from every track, but I love that all these tracks were there.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Quality of sessions varied, some people are better speakers than others.</blockquote>

<h4>Comments on the mix of tracks and individual sessions</h4>
<blockquote>Trackwise, I know some people have suggested a Star Trek track for next year and I'd love to see that! I also think it might be fun to have a misc. track for things that don't fit elsewhere (a Bujold panel got mentioned quite a lot). The way I'd imagine
	this working would be that people who wanted to run panels would gather panelists and pitch their session to the track head. The track head would then be responsible for choosing which sessions would run and for suggesting people with similar ideas merge
	them, and redirecting panels that might fit better with other tracks. That way there'd be scope for panels on fandoms too small to support their own track, and for more general genre/trope panels that don't fall under the umbrella of feminism, LGBTQAI,
	Race&Culture etc. Kind of like some of the ones on the All of the Books track, but not just about books!</blockquote>
<blockquote>A dedicated room for board gaming would be awesome next year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Would like con-long drop-in crafting room/place to go and knit with like-minded folk in gaps between other things</blockquote>
<blockquote>I missed the RPG and table top gaming tracks a lot this year! Could we have them back please. </blockquote>
<blockquote>I enjoyed the limited amount of Anime/Manga and MLP based sessions and would like to see more next year, perhaps within a dedicated animation track. I would also be willing to run some sessions in such a track myself, if I knew where to volunteer my services.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Really needed more board games/table-top gaming; Jim Butcher's dresden would be another suggestion...</blockquote>
<blockquote>enjoyed all the sessions I went to, but I wanted to make a specific mention of two people: Lauren O'Farrell, who spoke both about her own work and in the Political Needlepoints session, and was a warm and engaging speaker with so many interesting things
	to say. I left both her sessions really impressed and inspired. And Jaime, the track organiser for A Song of Ice and Fire, for the brilliant session on the portrayal of sex workers in the books. her speakers had some fascinating insights and the session
	was run very matter-of-factly, with none of the sensationalism that might have accompanied a similar talk at a different event.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I really missed the board gaming track from last year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I've missed the awesome Harry Potter track from last year a bit, but the offer this year was amazing!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Totally unsuitable - a real pain to get to and too expensive to stay for the vast majority of people. Loud, crowded and labyrinthine.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Overall the social spaces and session spaces were adequate. There were a few instances where demand was judged poorly or times when the social spaces became a little overwhelmed, but overall was good</blockquote>
<blockquote>Appreciated the car parking discount - thank you :)</blockquote>
<blockquote>I'm "very unhappy" with certain things relating to the hotel. First, they've charged me twice over for my stay. (Attempt to extract a refund are underway.) Secondly, I have never before â€“ well, except at last year's Nine Worlds â€“ had so much trouble with my room key repeatedly ceasing to work for no apparent reason.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Endless having to have the room keys reprogrammed at the front desk!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some spaces in the venue were very very cold (airconditioning)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Overall, though, the venue was good. Much prefer having it all in one place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I have run 3 cons in that hotel myself, so I guess I am biased.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Overall though preferred the Radisson to last year's venue - felt much easier to get between sessions</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Radisson's spaces were smaller than those in last year's hotel, and it felt that everyone was separated (not a lot of 'flow' to the space). Also, so many weird staircases!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bedroom was nice though, and convention discount price was good value.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I thought the Renaissance (Nine Worlds 2013) benefitted from the big open-plan lobby - there's no similar space at the Radisson and the con felt kinda empty a lot of the time</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Radisson was a really nice venue, and easy to get to (once you'd got to Heathrow)</blockquote>
<blockquote>All good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It was too hot</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loved the kids space.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Please could you put a reliable taxi number in the brochure too? A man on the reception was relucant to give me a number ' not hotel policy' (which turned out not to work anyway) and they also didn't offer to call me a taxi which suprised me- not great customer service for a lone woman! My hotel sorted it when I rang them.</blockquote>

<h4>Getting to the venue</h4>
<blockquote>Getting to the Radisson is easy enough, just long and tediuous.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The only problem I had getting to the venue was that the Heathrow trains don't let you use your Oyster card, which is frankly bollocks but is also something you can't do anything about!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Good instructions for getting to the hotel, especially actually mentioning the free buses from Heathrow</blockquote>
<blockquote>The location at Heathrow doesn't seem like a very good judgement. Didn't meet a single person the whole time who thought it was a good place to have it - although loads came in from out of town, all had come by train or flown into other airports.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Location was okay but still a bit of a nightmare to get to.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Understand why the con is there, but the Radisson is a pain to get to from Central London!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Travelling out to Heathrow is always annoying, but it was manageable, and better than a more expensive central venue.</blockquote>
<blockquote>They closed ALL the bridges over the Thames on the Sunday - not your fault but *please*!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Heathrow is a real pain to get to from the other side of London. 90min-2 hour commute at either end of the day went fun. I'd definitely prefer a mote central location. (Though the building was lovely)</blockquote>

<h4>Finding your way around the venue</h4>
<blockquote>Some of the session rooms were quite distant, so signage might be helpful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Venue was a tad difficult to navigate, but very cool!</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Raddison layout is odd but the map and signposting were good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The signposting was excellent!</blockquote>
<blockquote>The main lifts at the Radisson are a complete joke, both in size and the random nature of stopping and going up or down. We had a pram and were quite dependent on them, which meant some very long waits on occasion getting from our room on floor 2. More signage directing people to the stairs and requesting people use them would have helped.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Definitely a boon having the map on the inside cover of the programme, where it was easy to find quickly.</blockquote>

<h4>Social spaces at the venue</h4>
<blockquote>I feel like there needed to be a more general open social area with no specific purpose, like the bar/lobby of the Renaissance in 2013.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The social spaces could have improved, at least having areas where you didn't feel you had to buy something to sit.</blockquote>
<blockquote>a "village green" style social area with game tables, perhaps access to dealers room, inclusion of the "market" etc.. would create a more organic area to congregate in..</blockquote>
<blockquote>The massive landings on the 3rd floor were great social spaces.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The only good social space was the upstairs atrium, but it still wasn't easy to mingle and meet new people.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The social space in the atrium was great - cool, sunny and quiet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I would have liked a bigger social area that was designated as such - a bit like LonCon3's Fan Village (but smaller, obviously!) where you could go and decompress or enthuse to others about all the IDEAS! that the sessions had just put into your brain, or to continue the conversation, etc. A proper dedicated 24/7 gaming (board/card) room would have been nice.</blockquote>

<h4>Session spaces at the venue</h4>
<blockquote>Session spaces were alright although they had an optimistic view of how wide the average geek bum is!!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Generally the session spaces were good, except for the DW/Whedon room  where the noise from the other room leaked through.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Only suggestions are maybe a camera in the bigger demo sessions so close-up work could be projected onto a screen if possible</blockquote>
<blockquote>Radisson must have been trying to save on the air conditioning bill, it was very hot in some session rooms (had to leave cheese and cheese evening due to the temperature, not the cheesy writing...)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some sessions had many people sitting on the floor, when there was plenty of room for extra seats to be added</blockquote>

<h4>Noise levels in the venue</h4>
<blockquote>Would be super helpful to ensure doors closed at session starts to avoid noisy echoes from marble corridors, as well, and maybe some thought to not placing loud, boisterous panels right next door to quiet ones...!</blockquote>
<blockquote>The atrium area was quite loud. I ended up using the film festival room as a quiet room, but I think a deviated quiet room, set up on a similar way (cushions, comfortable temperature, decent wifi) would be really helpful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The only thing I could say is that in Saturday night the noise level of one the parties was so high I had trouble to sleep - but, hey, I'm not complaining! I wish I could be there (was too tried, alas... :(</blockquote>
<blockquote>Noise from other sessions were often a major issue in the rooms with temp partition walls.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Terrible noise pollution/bleedthrough. Hard to hear a lot of speakers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some noisy sessions were next to some quiet ones - especially the 'subdivided' rooms.  Not horrendous but mildly irritating.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Maybe next time you could not schedule social gaming at the same time as a panel as it made it difficult to hear the audience/panelists.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Quiet space was useful but sound leaked from corridor next to it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sometimes the noise in the foyer was a bit much but that's kind of to be expected and there were quieter places to go.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The sound in the evening discos was too loud. The bifrost was bearable and not too bad though left ears ringing didn't mind too much. But the Highlander vs Flash Gordon one was so so loud.</blockquote>

<h4>Wifi and mobile signal</h4>
<blockquote>What wifi??!</blockquote>
<blockquote>no WI-FI for 3 hours friday night and 2 hours saturday morning</blockquote>
<blockquote>Also I could not get the wi fi to work at all but the mobile signal was good.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hotel is awful for mobile signal, and the wifi seemed to be struggling to cope in the middle of the day, resulting in being unable to reconnect after leaving the venue and coming back.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Though it did eventually get fixed the wifi signal playing up was a sure sign that whoever was in charge didn't organise it for that many people to start with.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Mobile signal wasn't great. Having wifi was very useful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I don't think the WiFi was ready for so many geeks! It dropped a couple of times, but overall the venue was fine for me. My only concern would be if it will be big enough next time, as I hope the con grows.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Wifi struggled to cope with so many net savvy peeps in one place, not Nine Worlds fault or the venue's.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Serving pace in the bars was poor and the staff indifferent unless engaged with almost ebullient charm.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Surrounding area (particularly The Pheasant) gave some solid options, but in-venue was incredibly expensive and of variable quality (in particular the coffee at sessions & breakfast was awful)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Not enough vegetarian options for the Â£10 meals in the hotel restaurant</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hotel staff incompetent, made unnecessary comments about dietary requirements, food underwhelming, prices obscene. The McDonald's was better in every way!</blockquote>
<blockquote>The food and drinks were all massively overpriced - nearly Â£2 for a can of coke for example. The food itself was nice enough, but the staff varied between clueless, incompetent or just uninterested.</blockquote>
<blockquote>MEGA SLOW service in the bar downstairs, and they cranked the price for tea between Friday and Saturday.  The sandwich stand was a lifesaver but it looked like they were very understocked and had poor variety.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Drinks were insane.  Â£6.80 for a 330ml bottle?  Got drunk in the room before going to the evening events...</blockquote>
<blockquote>Breakfast was great but the rest sucked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>it's Heathrow - the drinks and food is unreasonably expensive for most people. on the Sunday morning con guests were refused entry to trunk and those with dietary reqs couldn't get breakfast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Food was decent and generously portioned.  Probably a bit expensive for some con-goers.  Not enough staff in the bar when con-goers were looking to refuel!</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some gluten/wheat free options would have been nice.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The bar was perpetually understaffed, varying between zero and one bartender at busy times</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some staff seemed to find serving "weirdos" beneath their dignity. Some were simply wonderful.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is a hotel, but the prices for what I would call "basics" (i.e. bowl of chips, ham sandwich etc) were quite steep. Also the automatic addition of a gratuity to what is supposed to be a voluntary gratuity is a little underhanded. On the other hand, the food itself was of a high quality, the nine-worlds menu was very nice, so I see it a little as "swings and roundabouts". thank you for the food guide it meant we could find more reasonably priced food outside the venue in the evening so we could vary our diet a little. The Radisson staff were amazingly helpful and polite.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The discount on drinks didn't seem to be applied consistently, and they always added a "service charge" for ordering at the bar! Also the atrium bar prices were more than downstairs despite having cheaper brands of drinks</blockquote>
<blockquote>This was a big improvement on vegan provision from last year, so well done on that. Though I didn't really like the hotel's food, they had a few vegan options and took off unwanted ingredients when asked. The nearby italian was good value and had tasty vegan options, but was closed in the day. The nearby pub had no vegan food at all. The hotel bars were inconsistent in having soy milk, so I sometimes had to go to another part of the hotel to get soy milk. Still, this is an improvement on last year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The supplying of free water is important and wonderful. Food was better than last year but lack of options still quite sad.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Excellent notes in the programme about special requirements, which made up for the hotel restaurant staff being unable to cope with a request for vegan food.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It did take a while to get served at the bar. Staff were always pleasant and friendly. The drinks seemed very expensive, even for London. Food was expensive, but not outrageously so. The food options seemed a lot better than last year.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I found the staff were always helpful when asked, although not always cheerful (though it was mostly one member of staff in the trunk who may have been having a bad day. in general I was happy with the service). One thing I would say is after having made a wonderful effort to give people the opportunity to choose not to interact with others (tags etc) on the first day we were pushed towards the big tables and we had to make it very clear on the second day that we wanted a table for two before the staff would seat us. in general though a great improvement on last year</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Radisson is a lovely space. The ability to sit and jot down some thoughts between panels and meet people over a meal (the special menu) was great.</blockquote>

220 responses were used in compiling the results of the survey, along with dozens of blog posts and feedback emails. The 220 responses were the result of cleaning up 237 submissions received from the feedback form to remove duplicates and merge split
submissions. The form was released on 26th August 2014 and closed on 5th September 2014, and was advertised through our mailing list, and on Facebook and Twitter:
<ul>
	<li>To maintain respondent anonymity, the original response data is not included in this report.
	</li>
	<li>Instead, we present collated information and representative comments taken both from the feedback form and from feedback emails and public blog posts.
	</li>
	<li>A screenshot of the survey form and its accompanying instructions is available as an image attachment at the end of this report.
	</li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ymQtUBemX4OAFwME-ex36P0kPhWxR93i9fu3HhIkhjc/pubhtml">The numeric data used in building the charts is available as a Google sheet</a>.
	</li>
	<li>The selection of survey questions builds on themes identified in last year's feedback report, which used free answer text boxes with sentiment analysis.
	</li>
	<li>Many questions used a forced Likert scale, with the option to not reply if the responder didn't have a view or didn't wish to answer. In the statistical analysis, we've made the slightly dubious assumption that these can be represented by equidistant
		numerical values in order to derive an 'average' response.
	</li>
	<li>We then made the even more dubious assumption that the formula sqrt((1300-n)/1299)*0.98*sqrt(1/n) can be used to derive a margin of error for each mean Likert score. We're open to suggestions on improving this, but the intention was to make the direction
		and reliability of sentiments as visible as possible, rather than guaranteeing 95% confidence. In particular, there may be issues with not using a t-score calculation for low sample size results in the inclusion section.
	</li>
</ul>
Last year, the survey was designed to elicit both positive and negative text responses. This year, a lot of responders used the 'tell us more' text fields to expand on particular negative issues they encountered. This leads to a disconnect between the
often-positive feedback figures and the comments, which are more negative. This is reinforced by the tendency of people to write something along the lines of 'Everything was great except for the following..', which yields one uncategorisable positive
comment and a list of negative comments. Of the 220 survey responders, 186 identified as attendees, 45 as speakers or performers, 24 as volunteers or organisers, and 2 as non-attendees. 1 responder did not select any response to the question about the
nature of their attendance. Based on their text field responses, we counted them as an attendee. The questionnaire was designed and the report compiled by Daniel Johnston, one of the core organisers of Nine Worlds, with input from the Nine Worlds organising
team and from Dan Cyren Karlsson.
